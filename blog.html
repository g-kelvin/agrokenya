                                    <p>The coffee industry has been one of the key pillars of Kenya’s economy since independence from Britain in 1963. The sector has been a significant earner of foreign exchange for the economy and provider of jobs. However, the exposure of the industry to the world economy and other emerging challenges at home provide policy makers with a huge task to ensure this sector retains its relevance and importance to Kenya’s economy.<br>
                                    On a cold and breezy afternoon in the middle of July, we arrive at the gate of Mbumi Coffee Farm located a few kilometers from the centre of the city of Nairobi. Mumbi Coffee Estate is one of the large coffee estates in Kenya, situated within the coffee growing former ‘White Highlands’.<br>
                                    Sitting on over 300 acres of land of pristine landscape full of coffee bushes, this farm, run by a family since the 1960’s, is a clear manifestation of what is wrong and what is right with the coffee industry in Kenya.<br>

                                    On our walk around the farm, one of the best maintained coffee farms, the Manager proudly shows us the best of coffee farming in Kenya: coffee trees that are over 100 years old, a pulping station, a coffee processing facility and a small coffee roasting machine for sampling.<br>

                                    As the harvest season approaches, the Manager shows us trees full of green coffee berries, a few of them turning red, the smile on his face telling the whole story of the good work the farm had done and the bountiful harvest they expect come the full harvest period.<br>

                                    However, it is our journey to the coffee farm that left us with a sense of fear for the future of Kenyan coffee. Our journey took us along the magnificent Chinese built Thika Highway, an eight lane behemoth that stretches into Central Kenya, with significant opportunities for growth of retail, residential, institutional and other investors, but that could spell a death knell to coffee farming in this area.</p>

                                    <p>Kenya small-scale farmers were the third highest earners in the world last year, says a new report. Despite the severe weather conditions occasioned last year due to the prolonged drought, farmers earned impressive prices at the Mombasa tea auction.<br>

                                    Tea industry performance report 2017 released yesterday revealed that auction average prices at Sh298 ($2.98) are amongst the highest globally after Sri Lanka Sh402 ($4.02) and Rwanda Sh320 ($3.20) per kilogramme of made tea respectively.<br>

                                    Kenya is the leading exporter of black crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas in the world, accounting for about 24 per cent of the global exports. Pakistan, Egypt, United Kingdom, UAE, Sudan and Russia top the list of export destinations of Kenya tea.<br>

                                    Samuel Ogola, the interim head of tea directorate under the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA), said the review period was characterised by low production but farmers earned good prices compared to 2016.<br>

                                    “The prices increased to Sh298 last year up from Sh236 recorded in 2016. The good prices are attributable to low supply and consistency in quality,” said Ogola. Production in the period under the review, Ogola said, with the tea sub-sector being rain fed, suffered from unfavourable weather conditions.<br>

                                    He confirmed production last year stood at 439 million kilogrammes, seven per cent down compared to 473 million kilogrammes in 2016. During the first half of the year depressed rainfall led to output decline.<br>

                                    “Drought was more prevalent in the East Rift leading to nine per cent decline to 152 million kgs compared to 168 million kgs while West Rift was down at five per cent to 287 million kgs from 304 million kgs.”<br>

                                    However, Ogola said the 2017 election anxiety had no impact on production. The report notes that five counties Kericho, Nandi, Bomet, Murang’a and Kiambu account for 66 per cent of the total production.<br>

                                    During the review period, area under tea increased to 217, 586 hectares in 2017 from 215, 846 Ha recorded in 2016. Despite the tea production drop, maintained position one globally in terms of black tea exports. However, tea export volume dropped to 415 million representing 13 per cent compared to 480 million kgs in 2016 a situation attributed to lower supply.<br>

                                    Tea earnings rose Sh129 billion last year from Sh120 billion in 2016, buoyed by higher prices at the Mombasa auction, making the green leaves the second highest Forex earner for the country. This is despite a seven per cent decline on yields caused by prolonged dry weather.</p>

                                    <p>Kenya’s mango farmers will soon be able to export their produce to China to prevent a price slump amid abundant harvest, a chamber of commerce official said Saturday.
                                    Chairman of Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce Zhuo Wu said during the Chinese Mango Festival held in Nairobi that they will soon start exporting Kenyan-grown mangoes to China in order to boost local farmers’ income.<br><i>“WE WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH KENYAN MANGO GROWERS TO ASSIST THEM TO SOURCE FOR MARKET FOR THEIR PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO ABSORB THEIR BUMPER HARVEST,” ZHUO SAID.</i><br>
                                    Zhuo said the Kenyan farmers from Machakos County, one of Kenya’s drought-stricken areas, approached the trade federation to help find market for their produce to prevent the perishable fruits from going bad and hence incurring losses.<br>

                                    “We responded to their appeal and were able to purchase 15 tonnes of mangoes and in the process putting money in their pockets,” Zhuo said.<br>

                                    East African Legislative Assembly Member Of Parliament Peter Mathuki said the event created awareness and visibility for the products and expanded the farmers’ pool of potential buyers.<br>

                                    “The Chinese have shown true friendship especially by buying the mangoes at almost three times the market price in order to assist their Kenyan brothers so that their farm products do not go bad,” the lawmaker said.<br>

                                    He welcomed Chinese investors to build factories in the area to take advantage of the abundant mangoes grown in the county.</p>

                                    Temperature – minimum 150 C to 300C   and 240C to 300C  optimum.<br>
                                    Rainfall- does well in arid and semi-arid with moderate rainfall, 750mm to 100mm<br>
                                    Soil factors- loamy, sandy loam, red, black soils free drain with pH ranging from 5.5-6.0<br>
                                    Sunshine- The crop does well where its exposed for at least 6-8hrs to sun light
                                    Altitude –up to 2100m above sea level<br>
                                     <b>Varieties</b><br>

                                    Washington naval, minneola and valencia<br>

                                             <b>Land preparation</b><br>

                                    Plough the land deeply removing all weed and stumps if any. Site the orange farm near accessible road for easy fruit transportation. The field require wind breakers hence its advisable to plant trees on the side since strong winds make the flowers and budding fruits drop, this compromise quantity of production. Trees planted may include eucalyptus; mulberry-sericulture may come along this line to enhance multipurpose farming.<br>

                                                <b>Planting</b>

                                    Transplant in the field at onset of rains. Clear the field and dig planting holes 60 x 60 x 60 cm well before the onset of rains, add well decomposed organic manure in the holes and mix with soil. Spacing varies widely, depending on elevation, rootstock and variety. Generally, trees need a wider spacing at sea level than those transplanted at higher altitudes. Usually the plant density varies from 150 to 500 trees per ha, spacing of 5m x 6 m. It is very important to ensure that seedlings are not transplanted too deep. After transplanting, the seedlings ought to be at the same height or preferably, somewhat higher than in the nursery. Under no circumstances must the graft union ever be in contact with the soil or with mulching material if used.</p>
